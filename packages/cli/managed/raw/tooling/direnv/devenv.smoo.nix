# This is the SmoothBricks shell contract — the wiring that pairs with the other
# managed files (tooling/direnv/repo-path, setup-environment.ts, the CI actions)
# and must stay identical across repositories. `enterShell` is `types.lines`, so
# this module's prologue and epilogue merge around whatever devenv.nix adds:
# mkBefore establishes the workspace root, PATH, and toolchain before any
# project step runs, and mkAfter restores the caller's directory last.
#
# Every explanation lives out here in Nix comments. Hook bodies are exported as
# shell text, so a comment inside one becomes part of an environment variable.

  # this is one gated module in the shared file rather than a second config
  # directory that would have to re-import and re-pin everything here.
  #
  # It is a profile and NOT a default package because pkgsCross.gnu64's cc
  # closure is 0.4 GiB against a default shell closure of ~5.4 GiB — a 7% tax on
  # every shell entry and every CI cache restore, to serve one command that a
  # macOS laptop runs deliberately. Nothing on Darwin links a Linux object.
  #
  # Why a C compiler is needed at all, when rust-std above is already installed:
  # ring, openssl-sys, libgit2-sys and libz-sys compile C for the target from
  # their build scripts, and build scripts are compiled and run even under
  # `cargo check`, so std alone stops at `ToolNotFound: failed to find tool
  # "x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc"`. The `cc` crate probes triple-prefixed tool names,
  # which is precisely what this wrapper's bin/ exports.
  #
  # Each tool path is derived from the wrapper's own `targetPrefix` instead of
  # being written out, so a nixpkgs bump that renames the prefix carries these
  # with it rather than leaving four stale strings that fail at build-script time.
  #
  # This profile supplies the toolchain and nothing else. CARGO_BUILD_TARGET is
  # deliberately NOT set: the triple belongs to the Nx target that asks for it
  # (`cargo-lint-x64-linux` passes `--target` explicitly), not to the ambient
  # environment. An ambient triple would make the check silently host-local
  # whenever the profile was forgotten — reporting green having compiled macOS —
  # and that false green is the precise failure this whole profile exists to end.
  # With the flag on the target instead, running it outside this profile fails
  # loudly at `ToolNotFound` and a host lint can never be mistaken for a cross one.

  # linux-cross is the only profile here, and the shape of the publish job is
  # why. A lean publish shell was measured and rejected, so the next reader does
  # not have to measure it again.
  #
  # The ceiling first: dropping rustc, Go, binaryen, the cargo helpers, python
  # and the clang/lldb tools leaves 2.21 GiB of a 5.41 GiB default closure
  # (`nix path-info -S` over the devenv profile, aarch64-darwin), and modules
  # only ADD — so collecting that saving means moving the toolchain OUT of base
  # and making every developer shell and every other CI job pass `-P`. A
  # forgotten flag then yields a shell that is quietly missing a compiler, which
  # is the same false green the paragraph above exists to prevent.
  #
  # Repair is what makes it unfixable rather than merely awkward. `smoo release
  # repair-pending` builds the historical release commits npm is missing, and it
  # gets their toolchain by running a plain `devenv shell` AT that checkout
  # (packages/cli/src/lib/devenv.ts). No flag is passed and none can be: devenv
  # throws for a profile the checked-out commit does not define — `Profile 'x'
  # not found. Available profiles: ...` — which is every release commit older
  # than the split. Leave the flag off and a post-split commit hands repair a
  # base without rustc; add it and every pre-split commit fails to evaluate.
  # Either way the break surfaces months later, in the one command whose whole
  # job is to recover a release that already went wrong.
  #
  # The publish job's OWN environment is not just publishing either: `smoo
  # release publish --prebuilt` runs each project's Nx `release-check` gate over
  # the merged artifacts, which is where a native or wasm artifact is validated
  # before it is packed. A lean publish shell removes those tools silently, from
  # the one step that exists to refuse a bad artifact.
  #
  # And it would not even pay: the Actions nix segment is keyed on
  # os+arch+hash(devenv.yaml, devenv.nix, devenv.lock) and is blind to the
  # profile, so a restore ships the whole NAR regardless, while the save exports
  # the closure that job realized. A lean publish job that won that immutable
  # key would hand the CI workflow a NAR with no toolchain in it. On any run
  # where repair has work the saving is zero anyway, because repair realizes the
  # historical default shell inside the same job.

  # One Go for every repository, same reasoning as the Rust toolchain: a compiler
  # is part of a cache key, so two of them mean two caches.
  #
  # Pinned to the patch release ttsc vendors inside its native package, because
  # that SDK is not overridable — ttsc exposes cache locations and
  # TTSC_TSGO_BINARY, never the Go it builds plugins with — so matching it is the
  # only way to have ONE Go rather than ours plus a dependency's. `smoo monorepo
  # check` enforces the match and fails with both versions when they diverge,
  # which is what makes this pin a maintained invariant instead of a comment that
  # rots.
  #
  # It needs its own input because the fleet's nixpkgs does not carry that patch:
  # devenv-nixpkgs rolling ships go 1.26.5 and its `go_1_27` is a release
  # candidate, while ttsc 0.28.3 vendors go1.26.7. Same idiom, and same reason,
  # for any single-package pin — one leaf package from a nixpkgs that has it,
  # lock-pinned, prebuilt, rather than a fleet-wide bump that would move rustc,
  # bun and node too. Not every pairing is reachable: ttsc 0.28.1/0.28.2 vendor
  # go1.26.6, which NO channel packages, so when no revision offers the vendored
  # patch the ttsc pin is what moves.
  #
  # The ownership boundary this pin sits inside, unchanged by it: our code is
  # built with the Go devenv provides, a dependency may vendor its own SDK, and
  # neither may leak GOROOT into the other. Go therefore arrives via `packages`
  # and NOT `languages.go.enable`, which would export GOROOT; on PATH only, each
  # toolchain resolves its own GOROOT from its own binary. With the versions
  # matched that crossing cannot misfire at all, so the unset in enterShell is
  # belt-and-braces rather than the fix.
  # Node tracks the newest AWS Lambda managed runtime, currently nodejs26.x. It
  # lives here rather than in each repository's devenv.nix because it is a
  # fleet-wide fact: declared in three places, the next bump has to find all
  # three, and the one it misses re-splits the fleet.
  #
  # An explicit major, NOT `nodejs_latest`. A tool that participates in cache keys
  # and native-addon ABI must not be spelled "whatever is newest" in one
  # repository and a fixed major in the others — and the two spellings agreeing
  # today is precisely what makes the drift invisible, because the fleet looks
  # unified right up to the lock bump that splits it. A floating attribute is a
  # version that changes without a commit, so it cannot be reviewed or bisected.
  #
  # 26 also closes a split this axis caused once: 24.0.x declares URLPattern in a
  # way that TS2403-conflicts with lib.dom in consumers emitting declarations,
  # which forced a ~24.13.0 floor on one side; 26 is DOM-compatible.
  #
  # `@types/node`, `engines.node` and `packageManager` are derived from this pin
  # rather than maintained beside it — smoo's syncRootRuntimeVersions reads the
  # shell's Node major, so this line moves them.
  #
  # Reading which version this resolves to: devenv.lock has TWO nixpkgs nodes and
  # the obvious one is a decoy. `.nodes.nixpkgs` is not what `pkgs` is; the
  # authoritative path is `.nodes.root.inputs.nixpkgs`, which indirects to
  # `nixpkgs_2`.

  enterShell = lib.mkMerge [
    # Prologue, in order:
    #
    # 1. The devenv wrapper runs from tooling/direnv; every later step expects the
    #    workspace root.
    # 2. PATH order is most-specific → least-specific, the same list the git hooks
    #    use, so a hook and a shell resolve one binary the same way.
    # 3. ttsc drives the native TypeScript 7 binary while Nx imports the TypeScript
    #    6 API, so the two must be named separately.
    # 4. On a cowshed host, Go and ttsc caches point at the shared store, so every
    #    workspace reads one warm cache instead of growing its own copy inside its
    #    image. Without one, ttsc stays in-tree for the CI cache action while Go
    #    keeps its normal per-user defaults. Both Go caches are content-addressed,
    #    so sharing them needs no patch — unlike Rust, Go keys on content and flags
    #    rather than on where the files live. An inherited value always wins so CI
    #    can place any of these caches itself. GOFLAGS carries -trimpath because it
    #    is Go's stable way to keep absolute build paths out of the artifact, and
    #    unlike Rust's trim-paths it costs no cache reuse.
    #
    #    ttsc's plugin builds use the Go it bundles rather than ours, so the
    #    repository's own Go work and ttsc's plugin builds are two toolchains by
    #    construction. Placing both caches in the shared store is what keeps that
    #    from costing a rebuild per workspace.
    #
    #    TTSC_GO_CACHE_DIR and GOCACHE stay separate for ownership, not
    #    correctness: both caches are content-addressed, so one directory would
    #    compile the same bytes to the same entries. What sharing loses is an
    #    owner. ttsc reclaims a Go build cache only when it resolved that
    #    directory itself — `ttsc clean` takes the cache whose source is
    #    TTSC_GO_CACHE_DIR and never one whose source is a user GOCACHE, which it
    #    treats as someone else's property. Pointing ttsc at GOCACHE therefore
    #    produced a directory ttsc filled and no repository verb could empty,
    #    measured at 35G here. A dedicated directory gives ttsc's half back to
    #    `ttsc clean` and leaves GOCACHE holding only Go work this repository does
    #    itself, which is one module.
    #
    #    That buys ownership, not automatic GC: ttsc prunes opportunistically only
    #    when it owns the whole cache root, which requires TTSC_CACHE_DIR unset,
    #    and a pinned shared root is the point of the block below. The trade is
    #    deliberate — one warm cache every workspace shares, reclaimed by an
    #    explicit verb, over per-workspace caches that self-trim. Go's own build
    #    cache trimming belongs to the go command and still applies to both.
    # 5. The shared setup-environment.ts bootstraps repository dependencies; a
    #    failure aborts shell entry instead of yielding a half-working shell.
    #    Repo-owned enterShell bodies merge after this prologue.
    # 6. The declared Nx remote cache (`smoo.remoteCache`), if the repository
    #    has one. secret-references.ts prints the two variables Nx reads — the
    #    server and the access token — and prints nothing at all unless the
    #    declared token has a value, because Nx accepts only 200 or 404 from a
    #    cache server: an unauthenticated one fails every task on 401 instead
    #    of missing quietly. It is eval-ed into THIS shell because that is
    #    where Nx runs; the export covers those two variables only, so the rule
    #    that keeps `smoo.secrets` inside the setup child still holds. An
    #    inherited server wins, so a CI job env is never overwritten, and a
    #    missing token costs a stderr line rather than shell entry.
    # 7. GOROOT is unset rather than set. With devenv's Go pinned to the patch
    #    release ttsc vendors, a GOROOT crossing cannot misfire on version at all,
    #    so this is belt-and-braces rather than the fix — it keeps the isolation
    #    boundary intact even while the two are momentarily out of step, e.g. after
    #    a ttsc bump and before the Go pin follows it. The boundary itself: our Go
    #    comes from devenv, a dependency may vendor its own SDK, and neither may
    #    leak GOROOT into the other. An inherited GOROOT names exactly one
    #    toolchain and so is wrong for at least one side, surfacing as `compile:
    #    version does not match go tool version`. Absent the variable, every Go
    #    resolves its own GOROOT from its own binary, which makes "whose Go is
    #    whose" a property of which binary is invoked — the only thing that can
    #    actually be reasoned about.
    # 8. On Darwin, drop nix CC/CXX so xcodebuild finds Xcode's clang (it supports
    #    -index-store-path); bun/node native addons find compilers through
    #    node-gyp. CC/CXX are what xcodebuild reads, which is why they go rather
    #    than being pointed somewhere else.
    #
    #    The Apple SDK is the same boundary, and dropping CC/CXX alone does not
    #    hold it. An outer nix stdenv exports SDKROOT and DEVELOPER_DIR pointing
    #    at nixpkgs' RECONSTRUCTED apple-sdk, so Xcode's own clang goes on to
    #    compile against that sysroot. It is not a substitute for the licensed
    #    SDK: apple-sdk-14.4 carries usr/include and the frameworks but NO libc++
    #    whatsoever — no usr/include/c++/v1 and no usr/lib/libc++* — so any C++
    #    build script that resolves the SDK by name dies at `ld: library 'c++'
    #    not found`, which a CMake `*-sys` crate reaches before compiling a line
    #    of the project. DEVELOPER_DIR is the half that hides: `xcrun
    #    --show-sdk-path` honours it, so even code that correctly asks xcrun for
    #    the SDK is handed the nix one, while `xcrun --find clang` and
    #    `xcodebuild -version` keep reporting Xcode and look healthy. It also
    #    defeats any later guard that unsets a nix SDKROOT and then re-resolves
    #    it through xcrun, because xcrun answers with the same tree again.
    #
    #    Only a /nix/store value is dropped. An SDKROOT the operator exported
    #    deliberately — the documented way to link Darwin from a Linux host — is
    #    left exactly as given. Each drop is announced, so a shell never silently
    #    swaps the SDK a build was compiled against.
    # Nx's fallback includes HOME or TMPDIR, either of which can exceed the
    # Unix socket limit in a checkout. Reuse devenv's short runtime directory,
    # while preserving an explicit directory supplied by Cowshed or the caller.
