# 190959a modules) and nothing here restates it. Note `original` carries no rev:
# that node is HEAD-at-lock-time rather than a release tag, so this pin buys
# coherence, not blessing.

# An unpinned `github:cachix/devenv` instead installs whatever HEAD is on the day
# a cold runner misses the store cache — a version that moves with no commit
# behind it, so it cannot be reviewed or bisected, and a CLI newer than the
# locked modules breaks eval-cache or flag compatibility with no diff to blame.
# `--accept-flake-config` makes it worse than untidy: it pre-trusts the
# substituters declared by a commit nobody looked at.
