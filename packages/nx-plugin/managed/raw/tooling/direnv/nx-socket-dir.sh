# Managed by `smoo monorepo`. Sourced by devenv.smoo.nix's enterShell prologue
# from the workspace root:
#
#   . "$DEVENV_ROOT/nx-socket-dir.sh"
#
# Exports NX_WORKSPACE_ROOT_PATH and NX_SOCKET_DIR for this Nx workspace, and
# drops the Nx state overrides another workspace's shell left behind.
#
# An inherited NX_WORKSPACE_ROOT_PATH that names another directory says the
# environment was bound for that workspace, and so were its Nx state
# overrides: NX_WORKSPACE_DATA_DIRECTORY, NX_CACHE_DIRECTORY and
# NX_DAEMON_SOCKET_DIR. They are absolute, so a repository shell that keeps
# an inherited absolute value (CI binds a shared tree that way) kept that
# workspace's, and every Nx here opened its task database and cache. A
# cowshed fork entered from a shell that had been in main's checkout did
# exactly that: its Nx held main's database on main's build volume, and the
# next land into main could not adopt. The smoo Nx wrappers drop the same
# keys on the same evidence (WORKSPACE_STATE_ENV_KEYS). An override
# inherited without a root, or with this root, is the caller's own and stays.
#
# One socket dir per Nx workspace. DEVENV_RUNTIME is keyed to the devenv ROOT,
# so every workspace sharing one devenv - a sibling repository, a
# copy-on-write clone, a scratch workspace created inside this shell - would
# land on one socket. The first daemon to claim it then refuses every message
# from the others ("received a message from a different workspace"), which
# reads as a hung Nx in a workspace that did nothing wrong.
#
# In a cowshed checkout, host shells, sandboxed jobs and land checks share the
# checkout's one Nx daemon record (cowshed specs/cowshed/04_sandbox.md), and
# the daemon that record names may run inside the sandbox. Every one of them
# must name the same socket dir, as the same literal path:
# - Nx's daemon adopts the environment of each client that connects, so its
#   plugin workers bind their sockets under the client's NX_SOCKET_DIR.
# - The sandbox admits Unix sockets by literal path. It grants the `nx` leaf of
#   <checkout>/.cowshed/run under the name cowshed hands its jobs,
#   <runtime link>/nx, and refuses the same leaf reached through any other
#   link: the worker's socket gets EPERM and its plugin fails to load.
# So a host shell takes cowshed's own short link. A checkout path is too long
# for the plugin workers' sockets ("exceeds the maximum socket length"), and
# Nx refuses a symlinked leaf, so only the parent is a link. Cowshed names the
# link after the checkout's mount and writes it as COWSHED_RUNTIME_LINK into
# the checkout's .cowshed/env at every supervisor start; the shell reads it
# from there, never re-deriving it, and never from the caller's environment,
# whose COWSHED_RUNTIME_LINK may be another workspace's. A host shell creates
# the link when cowshed has not yet, exactly as cowshed would. A link that
# leads elsewhere is reported and left alone.
#
# Without that link, a socket dir that already resolves inside this checkout
# is cowshed's binding for the job and stays. An inherited one that resolves
# elsewhere belongs to another workspace, so the workspace takes its own.
