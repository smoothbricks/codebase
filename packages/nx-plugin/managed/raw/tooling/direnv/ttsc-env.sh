# Managed by `smoo monorepo`. Sourced from the workspace root by devenv.smoo.nix's
# enterShell prologue, before nx-socket-dir.sh rebinds NX_WORKSPACE_ROOT_PATH,
# and by the git hooks, which run outside that shell:
#
#   . tooling/direnv/ttsc-env.sh
#
# Exports ttsc's environment for this workspace: TTSC_TSGO_BINARY, the native
# TypeScript compiler (ttsc resolves only the unscoped `typescript` package by
# default, which here is the JavaScript compiler API), and TTSC_CACHE_DIR and
# TTSC_GO_CACHE_DIR, where ttsc keeps the plugin binaries it compiles and the
# Go build cache that compiles them.
#
# The compiler is always this checkout's own. An inherited cache directory is
# the host's choice and stays (CI points it at a cache shared across runs),
# unless the environment was bound for another workspace: an inherited
# NX_WORKSPACE_ROOT_PATH naming another directory says so, the evidence
# nx-socket-dir.sh drops that workspace's Nx state on. Its ttsc cache is then
# dropped too, and this workspace takes its own. A hook inherits whatever
# environment ran `git`; run from a shell bound to another checkout, every
# commit here compiled ttsc plugins into that checkout's cache, and failed
# outright once that checkout's cache was gone.
