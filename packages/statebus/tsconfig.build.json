  // This config is used ONLY for generating .d.ts files during build.
  // It extends the main tsconfig.json but overrides "types" to prevent
  // auto-loading @types/* packages.
  //
  // WHY: bun-types/globals.d.ts has a bug where it tries to import
  // ReadableStreamBYOBRequest as a type from "node:stream/web", but
  // @types/node exports it as a const (value). This breaks dts-bundle-generator.
  //
  // CONSTRAINT: With types: [], Node.js imports (node:*) won't work in src/
  // because @types/node won't be loaded during build.
